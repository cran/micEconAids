\title{ Elasticities of the AIDS model }

\description{
   These functions calculate and print
   the demand elasticities of an AIDS model.
}

\usage{
   aidsElas( coef, prices = NULL, shares = NULL, totExp = NULL,
      method = "AIDS", priceIndex = "TL", basePrices = NULL, baseShares = NULL,
      quantNames = NULL, priceNames = NULL, coefCov = NULL, df = NULL )

   \method{elas}{aidsEst}( object, method = NULL, observedShares = FALSE, \dots )

   \method{print}{aidsElas}( x, \dots )
}

\arguments{
   \item{coef}{a list containing the coefficients alpha, beta and gamma.}
   \item{prices}{a vector of the prices at which the elasticities should be calculated.}
   \item{shares}{a vector of the shares at which the elasticities should be calculated.}
   \item{totExp}{total expenditure at which the elasticities should be calculated.}
   \item{method}{the elasticity formula to be used (see details).}
   \item{priceIndex}{the price index (see details).}
   \item{basePrices}{a vector specifying the base prices for the
      Paasche, Laspeyres, and Tornqvist price index.}
   \item{baseShares}{a vector specifying the base expenditure shares for the
      Laspeyres, simplified Laspeyres, and Tornqvist index.}
   \item{quantNames}{an optional vector of strings containing the names of
      the quantities to label elasticities.}
   \item{priceNames}{an optional vector of strings containing the names of
      the prices to label elasticities.}
   \item{coefCov}{variance covariance matrix of the coefficients (optional).}
   \item{df}{degrees of freedom to calculate P-values of the elasticities 
      (optional).}
   \item{object}{an object of class \code{aidsEst}.}
   \item{observedShares}{logical. Using observed shares for calculating the
      demand elasticities?}
   \item{x}{an object of class \code{aidsElas}.}
   \item{\dots}{additional arguments of \code{elas.aidsEst}
      are passed to \code{aidsEla};
      additional arguments of \code{print.aidsElas}
      are currently ignored.}
}

\details{
   Argument \code{priceIndex} has two effects:
   first it determines the price index that is used
   for calculating (fitted) expenditure shares,
   if argument \code{shares} is not provided (see \code{\link{aidsCalc}});
   second it determines which version of the formulas for calculating
   demand elasticities of the LA-AIDS are used,
   because formulas \code{B1}/\code{LA}, \code{B2}, and \code{Go}/\code{Ch}
   have different versions depending on the price index.

   \code{elas.aidsEst} is a wrapper function to \code{aidsElas}
   that extracts the
   estimated coefficients (\code{coef}),
   mean expenditure shares (\code{wMeans}),
   mean prices (\code{pMeans}),
   names of the prices (\code{priceNames}),
   estimated coefficient variance covariance matrix (\code{coef$allcov}), and
   degrees of freedom (\code{est$df})
   from the object of class \code{aidsEst}
   and passes them to \code{aidsElas}.
   If argument \code{method} in \code{elas.aidsEst} is not specified,
   the default value depends on the estimation method.
   If the demand system was estimated by the linear approximation (LA),
   the default method is 'Ch'.
   If the demand system was estimated by the iterative linear least squares
   estimator (ILLE),
   the default method is 'AIDS'.

   At the moment the elasticity formulas of the orginal AIDS (\code{AIDS}),
   the formula of Goddard (1983) or Chalfant (1987) (\code{Go} or \code{Ch}),
   the formula of Eales and Unnevehr (1988) (\code{EU}),
   the formula of Green and Alston (1990) or the first of Buse (1994)
   (\code{GA} or \code{B1}) and
   the second formula of Buse (1994) (\code{B2})
   are implemented.

   The variance covariance matrices of the elasticities are calculated using
   the formula of Klein (1953, p. 258) (also known as the delta method).
   At the moment this is implemented only for the elasticity formulas of the 
   orginal AIDS.

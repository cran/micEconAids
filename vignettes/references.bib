  based on Canadian time series data are presented and reject the current
  practice of static modelling while restrictions suggested by economic theory
  are not rejected when imposed on the long run structure.}

  system (AIDS), a demand system, developed by economists Angus Deaton and John
  Muellbauer. The homogeneity and symmetry restrictions which were rejected by
  Deaton and Muellbauer were tested with the more dynamic generalized AIDS to
  determine if the exclusion of dynamic elements may have accounted for their
  result. Annual United States time series data for the years 1948 to 1978 were
  used to estimate the demand systems. For the 11-aggregate commodity
  classification, the commodities were food, alcohol and tobacco, clothing,
  housing, utilities, transportation, medical care, durable goods, other
  nondurable goods, other services and other miscellaneous goods. The empirical
  results indicated the presence of habits or persistence in consumption
  behavior patterns of consumers when the AIDS is used as the maintained
  hypothesis. Autocorrelation was also found to have a large impact on
  elasticity estimates in the AIDS. The approximate proportionality
  relationship that exists for the additive linear expenditure system was not
  found to exist for the more flexible AIDS.}

  journal = {Energy Economics},

  volume = {29},
  number = {1},
  pages = {1-17},
  abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to examine how exogenous
  technological progress, in terms of an increase in energy efficiency, affects
  consumption choice by Swedish households and thereby emissions of carbon
  dioxide (CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx). The aim of the
  paper is closely related to the discussion of what is termed the "rebound
  effect". To neutralise the rebound effect, we estimate the necessary change
  in CO2 tax, i.e. the CO2 tax that keeps CO2 emissions at their initial level.
  In addition, we estimate how this will affect emissions of sulphur dioxide
  and nitrogen oxides. The results indicate that an increase in energy
  efficiency of 20% will increase emissions of CO2 by approximately 5%. To
  reduce the CO2 emissions to their initial level, the CO2 tax must be raised
  by 130%. This tax increase will reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide to
  below their initial level, but will leave the emissions of nitrogen oxides at
  a higher level than initially. Thus, if marginal damages from sulphur dioxide
  and nitrogen dioxide are non-constant, additional policy instruments are
  needed.}

  abstract = {A patent owner who is considering licensing its patent to a
  competitor faces a dilemma. By giving a license to the competitor, the patent
  owner stands to lose profits due to increased competition. In order to be
  willing to license, therefore, the patent owner must receive a royalty that
  at least compensates for these lost profits. The minimum acceptable royalty
  depends upon the competitive impact the potential licensee's product would
  have on the patent owner's product. We describe how to estimate
  econometrically this competitive impact and how a patent owner might use this
  information to determine the minimum acceptable royalty. We discuss the
  advantages of using a flexible functional form for the demand system
  specification that underlies the competitive analysis. Finally, using an
  empirical example, we illustrate the large differences that can arise between
  results based on flexible forms versus non-flexible forms.}

  abstract = {An Almost Ideal Demand System model is developed and used to
  estimate price elasticities for US cheese sold at retail. Growing consumption
  of cheese coupled with fierce competition between private labels and national
  brands serves as motivating factors for this study. Per capita consumption of
  cheese grew by 75% during 1980-2004 and private labels captured a rising
  share of this growth. Private labels today account for 35% of market share;
  national brands, for the remaining 65%. Kraft accounts for 45% of national
  brands, but price increases for Kraft brands led to a sizeable price gap
  between its brands and private labels. This gap helped to stimulate growth of
  private labels. Marketing managers seek to capitalize on both growing cheese
  sales and price gaps for brands. Relevant information for marketing managers
  is consumer sensitivity to price changes. This study uses 69 weeks of scanner
  data, with consumers segmented by income levels to derive price elasticities
  for both lower-and higher-income consumers. Results show lower-income
  consumers to be more price sensitive. If large price gaps are maintained, the
  results suggest continued growth of private labels. Yet, meta-analyses for
  this study suggest that Kraft could lower the price gap and regain market
  share.}

  commodity taxation (and none of the studies on second-best environmental
  regulation) actually estimate it. Using household data, we find that gasoline
  is a relative complement to leisure, and thus that the optimal gasoline tax
  is significantly higher than marginal damages-the opposite of the result
  suggested by the bulk of the prior literature. Indeed, even if there were no
  externalities at all associated with gasoline, the optimal tax rate would
  still be almost equal to the average gas tax rate in the U.S. Following this
  approach to estimate cross-price elasticities with leisure could strongly
  influence estimates of optimal rates for other important commodity or

THIS IS THE CHANGELOG OF THE "micEconAids" PACKAGE

Please note that only the most significant changes are reported here.
A full ChangeLog is available in the log messages of the SVN repository
on R-Forge.


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-8 (2012-06-02)

* added nobs() method for objects of class "aidsElas""


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-6 (2011-11-12)

* fixed partial argument matching in aidsElas()


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-4

* added a note in the "details" section of the documentation of aidsElas
  that explains how the adjusted alpha_i coefficients can be calculated
  if the model was estimated with demand shifters


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-2

* aidsElas() now stops and returns an error message if the model includes
demand shifters, because it (currently) cannot calculate elasticities
of models with demand shifters (it does not adjust the alpha coefficients);
the documentation of aidsElas() now mentions this limitation and gives a hint
how the user can use aidsElas() to calculate elasticities for models with
demand shifters anyway (the author of micEconAids is grateful to Jens
Hainmueller who reported this bug)


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-0 AND BEFORE

* please take a look at the log messages of the SVN repository on R-Forge
